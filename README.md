# What's a gANYrator?
gANYrator is a content generation system for tabletop RPG's such as Dungeons and Dragons. Build tables of content, link 
them together with actions, and then use them to roll random NPC's, Towns, Loot or more.

Many RPG systems provide random effects in the form of tables. Each table consists of a particular set of dice to throw 
and a number of items associated with particular results of the throw. For example, the following table of cookies 
provides a different cookie for each possible value on a six sided die (usually referred to as a d6). 

1d6 | Cookie Type
----|------------
1   | Raisin
2   | Plain
3   | Peanut
4   | Gingerbread
5   | Chocolate Chip
6   | Double Chocolate

When a random type of cookie is required, players would roll a six sided die and then look up the results in the table to
see what kind of cookie was found. Tables like this are used for everything from personality traits at character creation, 
to roadside encounters while travelling, and the magic items in a dragon's hoard. Many Game Masters (GM's) will create 
their own tables of random content personalised to the details of their world and game. Some particularly complex systems
involve rolling on a table whose results tell you other tables to roll on, whose results may require futher rolls on other 
tables which all contribute to the final outcome.

gANYrator provides GM's with a simple interface to create these tables in digital form and chain them together such that 
even the most complex rolls can be accomplished with the press of a button.

## Tables
gANYrator's tables consist of a number of items containing 3 things:
1. A Result, some text describing  what occurs when this item occurs
2. A Weight, how often a result occurs relative to the other results (This takes the place of the probability 
distributions involved in rolling multiple dice)
3. An Action describing any other tables that should be rolled on and how their results should be interpreted

## Actions
Actions tie the output of one or more tables together such that you can generate complex outcomes with a single button 
press. An action consists of a table to roll upon, and a field name to show the results under. By setting up an action as
your starting point, and having tables whose results roll on other tables, you can generate entire characters randomly
with a single button press, while having everything make sense logically for the world you are playing in.
